    <h1>My Journey To Choosing BSIT</h1>
    <h3>By: DEMECILLO, Christine E.</h3>

    <h2>Why Did You Choose BSIT?</h2>

    <P>Growing up, I often envied kids who lived a stable lives, those who could play games freely, without worrying about responsibilities and grades. <br>My life was different. I faced challenges early on, and was determined to break that cycle. I did not want to be a burden to my Family. <br>So I took the initiative to apply as a working scholar at the University of Cebu, and fortunately got accepted. <br>
    </P>
    <p>At first, I considered taking BSHM. But when I shared this with our eldest brother, who works as an architect, he reacted strongly and furious. <br>He questioned my choice, even sarcastically asking, "Do you want to be a dishwasher?" <br>His words has deeply offended me, and i was stunned, I dont know what to speak back. <br>But it made me reflect deeply on what path i should take. <br>
    </p> 
    <p>I want to be like my brother, because back then my brother had always an interest on taking BSIT <br>but he was offered a fully paid tuition if he should just take BSNAME. <br>My brother did not want to waste the opportunity and took the offer. <br>On the day i got enrolled, i have decided to pursue my brother's dream to dedicate his hard work and sacrifices for us. <br> 
    </p>
    <p>When people ask me before, "why BSHM?" i just tell them that I like helping people, without realizing that i can also help people in BSIT. <br>A memory came back to me months ago before enrolling at UC, one of my gaming accounts had been hacked. <br>That moment sparked my interest in technology and security. <br>BSIT was not my first choice, maybe not even my second, but i realized it held the potential to lead me toward a stable, successful future. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Despite how I started, I am committed. I may not have chosen BSIT out of passion at first, but i chose it with purpose. <br>I am determined to succeed not just for my self, but for my Family and the future I am working hard to build. <br>
